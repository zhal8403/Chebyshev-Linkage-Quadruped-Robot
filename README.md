# Chebyshev-Linkage-Quadruped-Robot
A small walking robot that uses a single 28BYJ-48 stepper motor and a Chebyshev linkage mechanism to generate four synchronized walking legs. Powered by an Arduino Uno R3 and a ULN2003 driver, it demonstrates mechanical walking using one actuator, with motion transferred through pulleys and rubber bands for flexibility.
