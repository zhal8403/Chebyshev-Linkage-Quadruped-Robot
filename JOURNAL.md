## 10/9/2025 9:30 PM - CAD Design  

I created the initial CAD model based on Thang010146's video of the quadruped robot in Onshape.

I adjusted and changed the model to fit the scale of electronics and my preferred size, then I adjusted the leg length to work better in my opinion. 

Then I split the design into printable parts: a frame with built-in electronics mounts, legs, pulleys, and linkage arms.

Exported parts as STL for printing and STEP for sharing/editing.

Uploaded all files to GitHub.

## 10/9/2025 9:42 PM - GitHub & Documentation  

Set up a GitHub repository for my Chebyshev-linkage quadruped robot project. Uploaded all images from Onshape, Arduino code, and BOM.csv. Organized folders for clarity and wrote a detailed README.md explaining the project, components, and assembly process.

This process helped me think through the order of parts, verify all components are accounted for, and make sure the design is easy to understand for anyone looking at my project.

Next, I plan to finalize my Blueprint project entry and link this GitHub repo.

## 10/9/2025 9:55 PM - Started Blueprint Project Entry and understanding of it  

I began my Hack Club Blueprint project entry by adding a description explaining the robotâ€™s purpose, the Chebyshev linkage motion, and how the single 28BYJ-48 stepper motor drives all four legs via pulleys and rubber bands. I also uploaded a banner image and additional CAD renders to clearly show the design.

I estimated the project cost to be around $30 for fulfillment, batteries, and jumper wires do to having the other necessary parts and total hours (~4 hours so far).

Next steps include 3D printing all components, assembling the robot with the electronics mounted on the frame, testing the walking motion, and documenting progress with photos and videos. I also plan to make adjustments for pulley tension and leg alignment during testing.

## 10/27/2025 - Printing first Leg prototype  

I printed the first test version of the leg to evaluate whether the holes were designed with the correct tolerance and to determine if the joint could rotate smoothly without excess friction or looseness. This test will help identify if any dimensional adjustments are needed before final assembly.
