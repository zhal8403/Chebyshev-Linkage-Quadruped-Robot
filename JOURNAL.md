This is my journal of the design and building process of **Chebyshev-Linkage Quadruped Robot**.

## 10/9/2025 9:30 PM - CAD Design  

I created the initial CAD model based on Thang010146's video of the quadruped robot in Onshape.

I adjusted and changed the model to fit the scale of electronics and my preferred size, then I adjusted the leg length to work better in my opinion. 

Then I split the design into printable parts: a frame with built-in electronics mounts, legs, pulleys, and linkage arms.

Exported parts as STL for printing and STEP for sharing/editing.

Uploaded all files to GitHub.

## 10/9/2025 9:42 PM - GitHub & Documentation  

Set up a GitHub repository for my Chebyshev-linkage quadruped robot project. Uploaded all images from Onshape, Arduino code, and BOM.csv. Organized folders for clarity and wrote a detailed README.md explaining the project, components, and assembly process.

This process helped me think through the order of parts, verify all components are accounted for, and make sure the design is easy to understand for anyone looking at my project.

Next, I plan to finalize my Blueprint project entry and link this GitHub repo.
