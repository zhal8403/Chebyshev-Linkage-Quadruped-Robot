This is my journal of the design and building process of **Chebyshev-Linkage Quadruped Robot**.

## 10/9/2025 - CAD Design  

I created the initial CAD model based on Thang010146's video of the quadruped robot in Onshape.

I adjusted and changed the model to fit the scale of electronics and my preferred size, then I adjusted the leg length to work better in my opinion. 

Then I split the design into printable parts: a frame with built-in electronics mounts, legs, pulleys, and linkage arms.

Exported parts as STL for printing and STEP for sharing/editing.

Uploaded all files to GitHub.
