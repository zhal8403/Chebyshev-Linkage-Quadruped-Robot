## 10/9/2025 - Designed the quadruped robot in CAD  

I worked on the CAD model of my Chebyshev-linkage quadruped robot. I split the design into printable parts including the frame with built-in electronics mounts, legs (front left/right, back left/right), pulleys, and linkage arms. I exported all parts as STL for printing and STEP for sharing the editable design. I also prepared the Arduino code to control the stepper motor and uploaded everything to my GitHub repository.

So far, designing the frame and integrating space for the Arduino, ULN2003 driver, and 9V battery has gone well. I also created renders from Onshape to show the full assembly, side view, and frame detail for documentation.
